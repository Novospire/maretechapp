# Capture Guide (MVP)

## Goal
Collect consistent, high-signal photos for non-binding detection. Not a diagnostic tool.

## General rules
- Bright, even light (no harsh reflections if possible)
- Hold still for 1–2 seconds
- Avoid wide-angle distortion if possible (step back slightly)
- Take 3 photos per area: wide, mid, close

## Corrosion
- Include surrounding context + close-up of the suspected area
- Avoid heavy motion blur

## Metadata
Device and app version may be recorded to improve quality over time.
